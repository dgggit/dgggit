# Jinho Ko

**Greetings!** :star_struck:	

I am a senior student mainly studying computer science in POSTECH, South Korea.

My research/development interest primarily relies on all kinds of **big data platforms**, including database systems and distributed systems. I believe introducing deep learning into these systems will let them behave much smarter. I'm also interested in data-driven technologies such as knowledge base and deep learning systems that may bring revolutionary business insights.

Details about my academic path are listed in my [academic blog](https://jinhoko.github.io/).  
I'm also running a [personal blog](https://jinhoko.github.io/jinhoko-com) where I occasionally write thoughts on technologies, books, and other stuff.
